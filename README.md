# ENIAC Vision Pro Simulation

A visionOS immersive app built with **Swift** and **RealityKit** that recreates ENIAC at life-size scale so users can stand inside a historically inspired machine room and explore one of computing's earliest milestones.

## What this app is

This project simulates the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) as an interactive spatial experience for Apple Vision Pro.  
The environment is designed to communicate ENIAC's physical scale, layout, and operation while letting users move through the space and inspect key subsystems.

## Features

- Life-sized ENIAC-style immersive layout in a room-scale environment
- Historically inspired U-shaped cabinet arrangement
- Animated indicator-light panels to evoke active operation
- Interactive information hotspots with readable pop-up panels
- Historical photo gallery integrated into the room
- Tuned room lighting, textures, and materials for simulator/headset viewing

## Navigation

- If you don't have an open space to walk around, don't worry. Look at the "hot spots" in the floor and select, and you'll be teleported close by. As a bonus, an information panel will open providing facts about ENIAC.

## Brief history of ENIAC

ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was developed during the 1940s at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School and publicly unveiled in 1946. It is widely recognized as one of the first large-scale, general-purpose electronic digital computers.  
Built with thousands of vacuum tubes and occupying a full room, ENIAC represented a major leap from electromechanical calculation to high-speed electronic computing.

## Why ENIAC is important

ENIAC proved that complex numerical computation could be performed electronically at unprecedented speed, influencing the architecture and direction of modern computers.  
Its development also highlighted the foundational work of early programmers who physically configured the machine for each problem, helping define software practice before software was formalized.
